The task is to prepare an analytical report for the HR department. Draw up recommendations on the recruitment strategy, as well as on interaction with existing employees.<br>
The database contains a set of tables that contain data about the employees of the fictitious company. All analytics should be done using SQL (subsequently, the data can be visualized, however, the final dataframes for the graphs must also be prepared using SQL).<br>

1. Managers:
    * The interrelatedness of managers with the ratio of employed/fired employees under their responsibility
    * Top 5 managers with a high employee leaving rates

    * The ratio of hired employees (for each of the recruiting sources)
